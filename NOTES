  # paths are dealt with by creating


# Allow the following:
# Text can be one of ::>
    # 'app.Resource'
    # 'full.path.to.ResourceClass'
    # ResourceClass

# embed does a drop-in instead of a reversal with URL

# path navigates the relation when preparing it

relations = {
    'choices': relation('polls.Choice', path=None, embed=False)
}

# equiv. to

relations = {
    'choices': ('polls.Choice', None, False)
}

# 3. relations are automagically created and pointed to the canonical resource
#    for the model; if none exists, a resource is created

# 4. API browser + registar

# 5. api.autodiscover()
