# 2. Only thing left with relations is to allow for
     `resource_cls(local=True, parent=self)` -- at least this is what I think
     would allow resource_obj.reverse to reverse properly with a local flag.
     Of course this would need to be recursive in order to retrieve deeply
     nested resources ala `/poll/1/choices/23/user/username`

# 2.5. Nearly forgot -- the ability to resolve something like the example
       above (`/poll/1/choices/23/user/username`) aka transversal.

# 3. relations are automagically created and pointed to the canonical resource
#    for the model; if none exists, a resource is created

# 4. API browser + registar

# 5. api.autodiscover()

# 6. `HEAD` and `OPTIONS`

# 7. `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH`

# 8. Reducing the size of the base resource

# 9. merging + cleaning up the test suite

--- GOAL! for wednesday night

# 10. pagination

# 11. filtering

# 12. sorting

# 13. authorization

# 14. documentation

# 15. release!
